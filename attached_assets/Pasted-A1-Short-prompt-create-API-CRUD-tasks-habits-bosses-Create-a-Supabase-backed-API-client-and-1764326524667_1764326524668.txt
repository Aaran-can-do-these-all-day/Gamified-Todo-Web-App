A1 — Short prompt: create API + CRUD tasks + habits + bosses
Create a Supabase-backed API client and React hooks for Tasks, Habits, Bosses and Players.
- Use @supabase/supabase-js.
- Provide functions: getTasks(playerId), createTask(playerId,title,difficulty,start,end), completeTask(id).
- Provide functions: getHabits(playerId), toggleHabitDate(habitId,date), getBosses(playerId), updateBossDay(bossId,day,success).
- Return code for src/api/*.js and src/hooks/*.js that work with Vite/React setup.
- Include brief readme on env vars and database schema.

A2 — Detailed prompt: generate full Tasks CRUD + XP/gold logic + client hooks
Project: Solo-Leveling Web app (React + Vite + Tailwind). Generate code for a Tasks system integrated with Supabase.
Requirements:
1. Supabase client at src/api/supabase.js (reads VITE_SUPABASE_URL, VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY).
2. SQL for tasks table:
   - id UUID PK, player_id UUID references players, title text, difficulty text, start_time timestamptz, end_time timestamptz, xp_reward int, gold_reward int, completed boolean default false, created_at timestamptz default now().
3. Utility to calculate XP and Gold:
   - difficulty multipliers: Easy=1, Normal=1.5, Hard=2, SRank=3
   - xp = round((duration_minutes / 30) * multiplier * 100)
   - gold = round((duration_minutes / 30) * multiplier * 20)
4. API methods in src/api/tasks.js: getTasks(playerId), createTask(playerId,title,difficulty,start,end), completeTask(taskId) that mark completed and return the updated row.
5. React hook src/hooks/useTasks.js that exposes tasks, loading, create(title,difficulty,start,end), complete(id) and auto-refreshes state.
6. Add a sample TaskCard component (TaskCard.jsx) with a Complete button that calls the hook and plays a simple XP animation.
7. Provide clear comments and error handling.

Return only code files and short usage instructions.

Section B — Prompts for Heatmap (interactive week-grid)
B1 — Short prompt
Create a React Heatmap week-grid component:
- Props: dates:Array<string 'YYYY-MM-DD'>, days:int (default 84), onToggle(date).
- Renders 7 rows (Mon-Sun) and N columns (weeks). 
- Each cell clickable and calls onToggle(date).
- Include Tailwind classes and smooth hover/scale animation.
- Output component code only.

B2 — Detailed prompt (DB + RPC + demo)
Produce:
1. Supabase SQL: habits table with id, player_id, title, xp_per_day, gold_per_day, heatmap jsonb default '[]'.
2. An RPC function or SQL snippet to atomically toggle a date in the heatmap JSON (optional).
3. React component Heatmap.jsx (week-grid):
   - Visual: 7 rows x weeks columns, hover scale and glow for checked days.
   - Accessibility: aria-label with date and checked state.
   - onToggle triggers a callback so frontend can call the Supabase toggle RPC.
4. Example usage in Habits page: list first habit's heatmap and add a toggle handler using supabase.from('habits').update({heatmap: updated}).eq('id', id)
5. Include CSS/Tailwind custom classes for animation and notes about performance on large datasets.

Return code + minimal integration example.

Section C — Prompts for Radar Chart animations
C1 — Short prompt
Create a React RadarChart component using Recharts with animation enabled.
- Props: playerId (optional)
- If playerId provided, fetch attributes from Supabase table 'attributes' (fit,foc,soc,dis,int,fin).
- Animate radar on load and on data change; customized stroke/fill using CSS variables (--accent, --accent-glow).
- Return component code.

C2 — Detailed prompt
Produce a fully animated RadarChart component:
- Use Recharts Radar + ResponsiveContainer.
- Play a 1.2s animation on mount and 800ms easing on data updates.
- Add a small pulsing dot on highest attribute.
- Provide sample CSS (globals.css) to implement glow via CSS variables.
- Include a small demo page where the player can click a button to increase an attribute and see the animation.

Section D — Prompts to seed Supabase (useful for demo/testing)
Create SQL insert statements to seed Supabase with:
- One player row (name: "Demo Player", xp_total: 450, gold: 120)
- Attributes row for this player with realistic values
- 4 tasks with varying difficulty and start/end times (some completed=false)
- 2 habits with a heatmap array containing recent dates
- 3 bosses with xp_requirement thresholds and reward_gold
Return a single SQL file content that can be copied into Supabase SQL editor.

Section E — Prompts for migration plan: React → Flutter (Android)
E1 — High-level migration prompt (short)
Create a migration plan to port a React + Supabase web app to a Flutter Android app.
- Provide steps to map components to Flutter widgets, map Recharts -> fl_chart, Heatmap -> custom GridView, Theme -> ThemeData and CSS variables -> ThemeData color schemes, Supabase JS -> supabase_flutter.
- Note data sync strategy and offline approach (use Drift or sqflite for local caching).
- Provide recommended packages and a 6-step timeline.

E2 — Detailed code generation prompt for Flutter app (component-level)
Generate a Flutter (Dart) project scaffold that mirrors this web app:
1. Use Flutter + Dart (stable), recommend using supabase_flutter for DB.
2. Create widgets:
   - PlayerCardWidget: shows avatar, level, xp bar, gold, name.
   - RadarWidget: use fl_chart RadarChart; fetch attributes from Supabase.
   - HeatmapWidget: implement week-grid of tappable squares; each tap toggles date via Supabase RPC or update.
   - TaskCardWidget: shows title, difficulty, xp/gold, complete button that calls backend.
   - BossPage: shows boss progress with day toggles and unlock logic.
3. Provide service layer supabase_client.dart for queries: getTasks, createTask, completeTask, getHabits, toggleHabitDate, getBosses, updateBossDay.
4. Provide example main.dart and routes (dashboard, quests, habits, gates).
5. Use ThemeData with three themes (blue, purple, fire); demonstrate runtime theme switching.
6. Include guidance for packaging and Play Store requirements.

Return code snippets and explanation for each file.

Section F — Prompts for assets & theme mapping
Generate a theme manifest JSON that maps web assets to Flutter assets and file names.
- For each theme (blue, purple, fire) list assets: dashboard-hero.png, gate-lycan.png, player-banner.png, icons (sword.svg -> sword.png for flutter), boss covers.
- Provide recommended sizes for Android drawable buckets (mdpi/xhdpi/xxhdpi) from the 1080p originals.
Return a JSON manifest and a short script suggestion for resizing using ImageMagick.

Section G — Prompts for CI/CD and Play Store (when ready)

Quick checklist & recommended libraries
For Web (current stack)

@supabase/supabase-js — DB

recharts — Radar

tailwindcss — Styling

framer-motion (optional) — animations

react-query or SWR (optional) — caching/sync

For Flutter (future)

supabase_flutter — DB

fl_chart — radar charts

flutter_staggered_animations or animated_widgets — nice UI effects

sqflite or drift — offline cache

provider or riverpod — state management

flutter_local_notifications / Firebase Messaging — push

Tiny migration timeline (practical)

Finalize web MVP and DB schema in Supabase (2 weeks)

Seed DB with demo data & document API (2–3 days)

Scaffold Flutter app + supabase client + basic PlayerCard (1 week)

Implement Tasks CRUD + Heatmap in Flutter (2 weeks)

Implement Boss logic & polish UI/animations (2 weeks)

Testing, offline sync, build signing, publish (2–3 weeks)

Final tips (UX & architecture)

Keep Supabase schema stable — both web and Flutter read/write same tables.

Use RPCs in Supabase for atomic operations (toggle date, complete task + award XP).

Abstract all DB calls behind a service layer so swapping DB later is easy.

Store smaller derived data locally for snappy UI (e.g., heatmap arrays) and sync in background.
